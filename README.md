## Hammers
### What is a "Hammer"?<br>
A hammer is an craftable item within Minecraft, that is behaving like a pickaxe itself<br>
but still adds functionality to the gameplay, as it destroys blocks nearby the breaking center<br>
at a given radius, that is determined by the **Level** of the hammer.<br>
At the moment, there are 6 tool materials, that a hammer can exist of:<br>
> *Wood*, *Stone*, *Gold*, *Iron*, *Diamond* and *Unbreaking*.<br>

These tool materials, except unbreaking, are representing the default pickaxe<br>
behaviour related to their material. In other words, a *wooden hammer* is as effective<br>
as a wooden pickaxe, in terms of the amount of time it takes to destory the block in the center<br>
and effectiveness against certain blocks and ores. So you cannot destroy diamond ores<br>
connected to the center of the destruction nor the centered block itself.<br>
In terms of durability, every hammer has its own. The higher the level, the higher the<br>
maximum capacity of blocks destroyable and therefore its maximum damage.<br>
The better the tool material, the higher the maximum life span of this hammer and therefore<br>
a higher maximum damage capability.<br>

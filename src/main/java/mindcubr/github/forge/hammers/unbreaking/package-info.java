/**
 * This package is handling and containing items and blocks
 * named after the "Unbreaking", as it is meant to allow
 * any breakable items to be unbreaking.  An unbreaking enchantment
 * out of vanilla Minecraft does not support <em>infinite</em> unbreaking
 * but <em>finite</em>, whereas this unbreaking specific type of
 * element is meant to be unbreakable <em>forever</em>, so <em>infinite</em>.
 *
 * <p>This package does not contain the {@link mindcubr.github.forge.hammers.UnbreakingHandler} that
 * is actually registering foreign and third party breakable items and stacks
 * to be Unbreaking-applicable.
